            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>In the beginning, there were digital agencies and creative agencies, each home to a specific set of competencies, but both limited in their approach. In 2018 we saw an opportunity to bring the two worlds together and founded Cready, a Geneva-based
                digital and creative agency equal in its reach for analytical research and creative design. </p>
            <p>We are a team consisting of strategists, analysts, writers, designers, and digital experts from different nationalities and backgrounds. Today Cready helps many national and global brands to convey their messages to the right audience with
                original content. We succeeded to grow by raising our targets day by day.</p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>All Cready partnerships begin with tailored quantitative and qualitative research to understand better and articulate the challenge at hand, including audiences, competitors, and brand perception. Our data science team uses web analytics,
                    CRM systems, and other secure data sources to identify target growth opportunities and inform seamless, human-centered UI/UX design.</p>

            <div class="info-grid">
                <h3>Illustration</h3>
                <p>We believe that creative illustrators/designers should not only be involved in the process with the project's visuality but also with all aspects and goals. Visuality alone is never enough to bring the right message to the screen. We are
                    trying to set up our design strategies without getting caught in what's popular to use as tools and programs but instead creating what's best for those projects.</p>
